# Impact of Interest Rates on the Economy and Banking Industry: A Predictive and Forecasting Analysis using Machine Learning and Time Series Models

## Project Description

In this project, we delved into the intricate relationships between interest rates and various macroeconomic factors. Utilizing advanced data analysis, machine learning, and time series forecasting techniques, we aimed to predict interest rates and understand how changes in macroeconomic factors influence these rates. Our goal was to develop robust models and conduct sensitivity analysis to provide insights into the dynamics of the economy and the banking industry.

## Problem Statement:

Interest rates are a critical component of economic stability and growth. They influence borrowing, investment, and consumer spending. This project aimed to predict future interest rates and analyze the impact of various macroeconomic factors on these rates. By leveraging machine learning and time series models, we sought to uncover complex relationships and provide accurate predictions to inform economic policy and decision-making.

## Data Collection

To address this problem, we collected a comprehensive dataset comprising various macroeconomic indicators such as GDP, unemployment rate, weekly earnings, deposit rate, interest rate, and yield. This dataset enabled us to capture the diverse economic interactions and behaviors over time.

## Analytical Process

### Data Preparation
• Loaded and cleaned the dataset, ensuring completeness and accuracy.<br>
• Standardized features to ensure consistency and improve model performance.<br>
• Split the data into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance effectively.<br>

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
• Visualized relationships between different macroeconomic factors and interest rates using pair plots and correlation matrices.<br>
• Identified significant correlations and interactions that guided feature selection for modeling.<br>

### Machine Learning Models
• Trained and evaluated two machine learning models: Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor.<br>
• Assessed model performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R2) metrics.<br>
• Random Forest Regressor demonstrated superior performance, capturing complex relationships more effectively.<br>

### Time Series Forecasting
• Applied ARIMA models to predict future interest rates based on historical data.<br>
• Visualized and compared model predictions with historical interest rates to assess accuracy and trends.<br>

### Sensitivity Analysis
• Conducted sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of changes in different macroeconomic factors on interest rate predictions.<br>
• Varied each feature within a ±10% range while keeping others constant and visualized the impact on predictions.<br>
• Identified key factors such as GDP and unemployment that significantly influence interest rates.<br>
